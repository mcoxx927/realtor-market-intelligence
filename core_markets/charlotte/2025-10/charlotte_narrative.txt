Charlotte's October 2025 market reads as NEUTRAL with a health score of 46, signaling a balanced environment that is slowly tilting toward buyers. Total sales reached 1,706 against 6,232 active listings, with a weighted average price of $418,572 and average days on market at 62. There are no identified hot markets this month, and several core submarkets land in buyer-leaning territory, which keeps overall momentum muted even as activity remains steady.

Over the past six months, pricing has softened. The metro median price slipped from about $440,869 in May to $430,418 in October, while DOM increased from 51 to 67 days. Inventory has remained elevated, hovering between 9,898 and 9,384 listings and only easing slightly into October. This pattern points to growing price sensitivity and longer decision cycles. In the next 3-6 months, expect stable to slightly softer pricing and a continued need for competitive positioning, particularly in markets like Charlotte, Huntersville, Rock Hill, Gastonia, and Mooresville that currently favor buyers.

Sellers should price at market value and plan for 60-75 days on market, with concessions likely in buyer-leaning areas. Buyers have meaningful leverage, especially where prices are down year over year, such as Concord (-6.3%) and Huntersville (-5.3%), and where DOM is high, such as Rock Hill at 76 days. Investors should underwrite longer holds and prioritize demand stability. Charlotte proper still drives volume (954 sales at a $424,000 median) but does not show strong price acceleration, while Gastonia offers modest price growth (+4.7%) but a higher 5.8 months of supply, which can pressure exit timing.

The balanced tier is led by Concord, Kannapolis, Indian Trail, Monroe, and Matthews, which should provide the best mix of liquidity and pricing realism. With no hot markets flagged, the edge goes to disciplined underwriting and deal selectivity rather than aggressive bidding. Markets with persistent price declines or elevated DOM warrant extra diligence on renovation scope and list strategy.

Actionable insights:
1) In buyer markets, target listings above 60 DOM for price concessions or seller-paid closing costs.
2) For new listings, price at or slightly below recent comps to avoid 70+ DOM outcomes.
3) Investors should focus on balanced markets and structure exits for 90-120 days rather than quick flips.
