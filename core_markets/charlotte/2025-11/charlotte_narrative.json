  "narrative": "Charlotte's November 2025 market is SLIGHTLY_BEARISH with a health score of 38, indicating a buyer-leaning environment with softening demand. Total sales were 1,357 against 6,004 active listings, with an average median price of $414,996 and average days on market at 63. No hot markets were identified, and only Charlotte, Monroe, and Kannapolis sit in balanced territory, while most other core cities are buyer markets. That tilt keeps negotiation leverage on the buyer side and requires tighter pricing discipline to move inventory.\n\nThe last six months show gradual price softening and longer marketing timelines. Metro median price fell from about $444,606 in June to $431,896 in November, with a trough in October at $427,742. Days on market climbed from 53 to 68 over the same window, signaling slower absorption. Inventory hovered near 10,000 listings in mid-summer but eased to 8,922 in November, which may limit further supply buildup but does not yet signal a rapid rebound. Over the next 3-6 months, expect stable to slightly softer pricing with continued sensitivity to condition, concessions, and overpricing.\n\nFor sellers, price at or slightly below recent comps and plan for 60-75 day timelines. Submarkets with elevated months of supply or very long DOM need more aggressive strategies: Mooresville shows 100 DOM and 7.2 months of supply, and Kannapolis is at 6.1 months of supply. Huntersville is down 5.2% YoY with a low health score, so expect pushback on premium pricing. Buyers should focus on the buyer-leaning cities (Huntersville, Gastonia, Concord, Rock Hill, Indian Trail, Fort Mill, Mooresville) where concessions are more attainable. Investors should underwrite longer holds and emphasize areas with steadier liquidity. Charlotte proper still drives volume (747 sales at a $424,900 median), but the broader metro lacks strong price acceleration. Gastonia's 5.9 months of supply suggests longer exit timelines for flips.\n\nOverall, the market remains active but slower, and the absence of hot markets means deal performance will depend on micro-market selection and pricing realism. Balanced markets like Charlotte, Monroe, and Kannapolis should offer the best mix of liquidity and negotiation flexibility, while high-inventory pockets carry higher holding risk. Focus on clean execution and avoid overpaying for expectation of quick appreciation.\n\nActionable insights:\n1) In Mooresville and Kannapolis, underwrite for deeper concessions or seller-paid closing costs due to high supply.\n2) Price new listings 1-3% below recent comps to reduce 70+ DOM risk in buyer-leaning submarkets.\n3) Investors should target balanced areas and plan for 90-120 day holds rather than quick flips."
