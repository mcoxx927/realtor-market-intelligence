  "narrative": "The Charlotte market enters November with a Market Health Score of 38 out of 100, signaling a slightly bearish environment that continues to tilt in favor of buyers. With 6,004 active listings and 1,357 sales closed during the month, the market is displaying softening demand even as inventory has begun to moderate from summer peaks. The median price of $414,996 reflects a market that has pulled back from the $444,606 level seen in June, though prices have stabilized somewhat over the past two months. Days on market have extended to 63 days on average, up from 53 days just five months ago, indicating that sellers are waiting longer to secure qualified buyers. While no submarkets are currently exhibiting strong seller conditions, several areas across the region are showing excess inventory levels that warrant close attention.\n\nThe six-month trend pattern reveals a market in transition rather than free fall. Prices declined approximately 3% from June through November, but the October-to-November period showed a modest uptick suggesting we may be finding a new equilibrium. More telling is the inventory trajectory: after hovering above 9,900 units for four consecutive months, active listings dropped to 8,922 in November, a decline of over 700 units that could signal the seasonal slowdown is absorbing some of the excess supply. Among the top-volume cities, Charlotte proper maintains the healthiest profile with a 58-day marketing period and a modest 1.2% year-over-year price gain to $424,900, while Huntersville shows more pronounced weakness at a $578,500 median with a 5.2% annual decline. Gastonia, at a more affordable $299,000 median, is experiencing an extended 80-day marketing period, and Concord sits at $387,750 with 69 days on market.\n\nFor sellers, this environment demands realistic pricing from day one. Properties priced within 3% of comparable sales are moving in the 60-70 day window, but overpricing is proving costly as several submarkets now carry more than six months of supply. Sellers should expect negotiations on price, closing costs, or repairs. Buyers, meanwhile, are in a position to be selective and patient. Offers 5-7% below list price on properties that have been marketed for more than 75 days are gaining traction, and inspection-based negotiations are back on the table. For investors, this is a hold-and-accumulate market rather than a fix-and-flip environment given the extended marketing times. Properties in Charlotte proper with the 58-day absorption and stable year-over-year performance offer better liquidity for those who need exit flexibility, while value-oriented submarkets may provide stronger rental yields but require longer holding periods.\n\nActionable insights: First, monitor the inventory trend closely through year-end; if the November decline continues into December, we may see the market health score improve into the low 40s by Q1 2026. Second, any submarket currently showing more than 90 days on market and six-plus months of inventory should be approached with caution for acquisitions unless the rental fundamentals are compelling. Third, sellers listing in January should price 2-4% below the November median in their specific city to capture early-year buyer activity before spring inventory arrives."
