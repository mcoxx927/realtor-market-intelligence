  "narrative": "The Roanoke metropolitan market closed December 2025 in a neutral position with a health score of 54 out of 100, reflecting a market balanced between buyer and seller advantage. With 218 sales and 548 active listings, the market shows adequate but not overwhelming activity. The median price of $320,139 and an average of 32 days on market suggest properties are moving at a reasonable pace, though sellers should expect a more measured transaction process than in the tighter market conditions of recent years. Inventory has decreased notably from 716 units in October to 587 in December, which may indicate strengthening conditions heading into the new year.\n\nPrice volatility has been the defining characteristic of the past six months, with median values swinging from a high of $360,471 in October to a low of $308,896 in November before rebounding to $342,771 in December. This 17 percent range suggests significant variation in product mix and buyer activity across recent months. Days on market have similarly fluctuated between 22 and 37 days, though the current 36-day timeline represents a moderation from the faster pace seen in mid-2025. The declining inventory trend since summer, dropping 19 percent from the July peak of 679 units, suggests we may see firmer pricing and faster absorption in the first quarter of 2026 if listing activity remains constrained. However, notable divergence exists across submarkets, with some areas experiencing strong seller conditions while others show excess inventory that will likely weigh on local pricing.\n\nFor sellers, pricing discipline remains essential given the 32-day average marketing period. Properties in core city of Roanoke are moving quickly at 24 days on market with a median of $225,000 and a 60 health score, though year-over-year prices are down 3.0 percent. In contrast, Cave Spring commands a $350,000 median but requires 52 days to sell with a 47 health score, despite showing positive 3.6 percent year-over-year growth. Sellers should anticipate four to six weeks of market exposure and price competitively within the first two weeks of listing. Buyers have gained negotiating leverage compared to six months ago, particularly in submarkets showing elevated days on market exceeding 80 to 109 days. Focus on properties with extended market time and consider requests for closing cost assistance or repairs. Investors should note the performance contrast between markets: Hollins offers a $325,000 median with only 17 days on market and impressive 16.1 percent year-over-year appreciation, making it attractive for fix-and-flip strategies with quick exits. Meanwhile, North Shore shows strong fundamentals with an $877,000 median and 12.1 percent year-over-year gains, though the 41-day marketing period and higher price point suit buy-and-hold investors targeting appreciation and rental income from premium properties.\n\nActionable insights: First, monitor inventory levels closely in January, as a continued decline below 550 units would signal a shift toward seller advantage and faster price appreciation. Second, avoid submarkets currently flagged for attention where days on market exceed 80 days or year-over-year price declines approach 26 percent, as these areas face structural headwinds requiring deeper discounts. Third, prioritize submarkets demonstrating both sub-20-day absorption and double-digit year-over-year gains for time-sensitive investment strategies requiring quick liquidity."
