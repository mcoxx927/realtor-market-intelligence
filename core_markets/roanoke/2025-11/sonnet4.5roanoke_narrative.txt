ROANOKE MARKET BRIEFING - NOVEMBER 2025

The Roanoke metro real estate market enters November with a Market Health Score of 56 out of 100, signaling a slightly bullish environment that continues to lean toward sellers despite some moderating forces. With 219 sales closed against 632 active listings and an average median price of $297,101, the market is experiencing a notable recalibration after several months of volatility. Days on market have compressed to 24 days in November after peaking at 37 days in October, suggesting renewed buyer urgency even as inventory has decreased from its October high of 716 units to 667 units currently. This represents a market searching for equilibrium after the price compression we've witnessed over the past six months, where median prices dropped from $366,651 in June to $307,428 in November.

The six-month trend reveals a market undergoing significant price discovery, with the 16 percent decline from summer peaks creating distinct opportunities and challenges across different submarkets. Salem stands out as one of the hot markets despite experiencing a 15.8 percent year-over-year price decline to a $265,000 median, maintaining strong seller conditions with an 80 health score and just 17 days on market. Meanwhile, areas requiring immediate attention include North Shore, where the median has dropped 23.9 percent year-over-year to $541,500 with a concerning health score of only 30, and Cloverdale, which has seen a dramatic 46.7 percent year-over-year price correction. The improving days-on-market metric from October's 37 days to November's 24 days suggests that pricing has finally reached levels that are activating demand, positioning the market for potential stabilization through early 2026.

For sellers, the current environment demands aggressive pricing strategies that acknowledge the 16 percent correction from summer highs. Properties priced competitively within 5 percent of recent comparable sales should expect the current 24-day absorption timeline, but overpricing will result in extended market time similar to October's 37-day average. Sellers in Salem and Vinton should capitalize on their strong health scores and compressed market times, while those in Hollins, with its 40 health score and 31 days on market, need to price particularly carefully to avoid sitting idle. Buyers now have legitimate negotiation leverage in most areas outside the hot markets of Salem, Vinton, and Westlake Corner, particularly in submarkets showing price weakness like North Shore and Cloverdale where motivated sellers may accept offers below list price. Rocky Mount presents the clearest buyer advantage with excess inventory conditions. Investors should consider a hold strategy in appreciating areas like Cave Spring, which maintains a 60 health score with 5.8 percent year-over-year growth at a $365,000 median, while value-add flip opportunities exist in distressed submarkets like Cloverdale where the 46.7 percent price decline may have created below-replacement-cost entry points.

ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS:

1. Monitor Salem closely: Despite the 15.8 percent year-over-year price decline, its 80 health score and 17 days on market indicate this correction has created a value entry point rather than a distressed market, making it ideal for both investors and owner-occupants.

2. Avoid North Shore for now: The combination of a 23.9 percent year-over-year decline, 30 health score, and $541,500 median suggests this luxury segment hasn't found its floor yet.

3. Act on the velocity shift: The 13-day improvement in days on market from October to November signals that motivated buyers are returning at current price levels, suggesting we've passed peak buyer leverage and the window for deep discounts is narrowing.
