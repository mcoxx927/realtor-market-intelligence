  "narrative": "Roanoke's October 2025 market is SLIGHTLY_BULLISH with a health score of 64, indicating a mild seller advantage. Total sales were 227 with 659 active listings, a weighted average price of $349,140, and average DOM of 33. Demand remains healthy and absorption is solid, keeping pricing power in the hands of well-positioned sellers.\n\nMomentum has been positive over the last six months. The metro median price rose from roughly $325,039 in May to $370,546 in October. At the same time, DOM expanded from 19 to 36 days and inventory increased from 596 to 705 listings. This mix suggests demand is still strong but cooling at the margins as supply rebuilds. Over the next 3-6 months, expect continued price support with slightly longer market times, especially outside the hottest submarkets.\n\nSellers in hot markets like Roanoke, Hollins, and Blue Ridge can still price at or just above comps, but should plan for 30-40 day timelines as DOM trends higher. Buyers should concentrate on pockets showing price compression: Cave Spring (-17% YoY), North Shore (-8% YoY), Vinton (-11% YoY), and Daleville (-15% YoY). These areas offer negotiating room and may reward patient searching. Investors should prioritize stable-demand zones with strong velocity. Roanoke proper posted 106 sales at a $239,500 median and Hollins carries a tight 1.6 months of supply, while Salem shows strong price momentum (+42% YoY) but warrants careful exit assumptions.\n\nAlerts are concentrated in price-declining or slow-turn submarkets such as Cave Spring, North Shore, and Rocky Mount (80 DOM). This is not a broad market weakness, but a signal to tailor acquisition and listing strategy by micro-market. Overall, the metro remains healthy, but success will come from selecting submarkets with sustained demand rather than relying on market-wide tailwinds.\n\nActionable insights:\n1) Prioritize acquisitions in Roanoke, Hollins, and Salem where demand is most consistent.\n2) Use price-decline areas to negotiate 2-4% below comps or request repair credits.\n3) Underwrite for slightly longer holds (45-60 days) given the DOM trend."
