## COMMON QUESTIONS

**Q: Why are both markets at 58 days on market but different health scores?**
A: Absolute value is same, but trends differ. Charlotte increased 20% YoY, Roanoke 29% YoY. Also, other factors (price trends, inventory, pending ratio) contribute to health scores.

**Q: Is higher inventory good or bad?**
A: Depends on perspective. Good for buyers (more choice), challenging for sellers (more competition). The 35-40% YoY increases represent major market shifts toward buyer-favorable conditions.

**Q: Should I wait to buy/sell?**
A: Timing markets is difficult. Focus on your personal situation and current conditions. Reports provide context but aren't crystal balls. October outlook sections offer some guidance.

**Q: How accurate are the health scores?**
A: Scores are calculated using proven indicators but are interpretive. Use them as guides, not gospel. Real estate is local - specific properties and neighborhoods may vary.

**Q: What's most important metric to watch?**
A: No single metric tells whole story. Watch:
- Price trends (direction)
- Days on market (velocity)
- Pending ratio (demand)
- Inventory YoY (supply shift)

3. **Focus on your specific market** - don't mix Charlotte and Roanoke insights
4. **Read the context** - numbers need interpretation
5. **Check watch items** - forward-looking indicators matter
6. **Adjust strategy** based on health scores and sentiment
