# Roanoke Metro Real Estate Market Intelligence Report
## September 2025

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Roanoke, VA metropolitan area processed 243 home sales across 17 cities in September 2025, demonstrating explosive market momentum with sales surging 48.6% year-over-year. Despite rapid inventory growth of 58.2% YoY, the metro maintains ultra-tight conditions with just 2.8 months of supply and a remarkably fast median 26-day marketing period. The weighted median sale price of $357,566 reflects modest appreciation of 4.1% YoY, suggesting demand is outpacing supply growth in this smaller, high-velocity market.

**Key Takeaway:** Roanoke represents one of Virginia's hottest real estate markets, combining rapid sales growth with minimal inventory and lightning-fast absorption times. The market dramatically outperforms Charlotte's metrics across all velocity indicators.

**Recommended Action:** Sellers should capitalize on extreme buyer demand with aggressive pricing, expecting offers within 3-4 weeks. Buyers must act decisively without extended due diligence periods, as top properties receive multiple offers quickly.

## TOP 10 CITIES BY SALES VOLUME

### 1. Roanoke, VA
**Sales Volume:** 101 homes | **Health Score:** 75/100

- **Median Sale Price:** $224,000 (-3.4% YoY)
- **Days on Market:** 24 days
- **Inventory:** 334 homes
- **Months of Supply:** 3.3
- **Sale-to-List Ratio:** 0.969

**Market Dynamics:**
The core Roanoke market dominates the metro with 41.6% of all transactions. Despite a significant -31.8% MoM sales decline (likely seasonal), the market maintains healthy fundamentals with 24-day DOM (versus Charlotte's 60 days). Inventory surged 86.6% YoY, yet the 3.3-month supply barely approaches balanced conditions, indicating robust absorption capacity.

**Assessment:** Fast-paced market with strong buyer urgency. The -3.4% YoY price decline appears tactical rather than structural, as sellers adjust pricing to maintain velocity in a growing inventory environment. Properties priced correctly move within a month.

---

### 2. Cave Spring, VA
**Sales Volume:** 28 homes | **Health Score:** 78/100

- **Median Sale Price:** $367,000 (+3.4% YoY)
- **Days on Market:** 18 days
- **Inventory:** 88 homes
- **Months of Supply:** 3.1
- **Sale-to-List Ratio:** 0.977

**Market Dynamics:**
Cave Spring exemplifies Roanoke's premium suburban market, with median prices 64% above core Roanoke and lightning-fast 18-day DOM. Sales increased 21.7% YoY while inventory jumped 54.4% YoY, yet supply remains tight at 3.1 months. The health score of 78 reflects strong balanced performance across all metrics.

**Assessment:** Highly desirable suburban market with sustained demand. Inventory growth provides buyers with choices while maintaining seller advantages through rapid absorption. Premium properties command strong pricing power.

---

### 3. Salem, VA
**Sales Volume:** 26 homes | **Health Score:** 83/100 *(SECOND HIGHEST IN METRO)*

- **Median Sale Price:** $290,000 (-7.9% YoY)
- **Days on Market:** 21 days
- **Inventory:** 67 homes
- **Months of Supply:** 2.6
- **Sale-to-List Ratio:** 1.001

**Market Dynamics:**
Salem achieves an exceptional 83 health score despite -7.9% YoY price decline, demonstrating that velocity and absorption matter more than nominal appreciation in market health calculations. The 1.001 sale-to-list ratio indicates properties selling at or above asking price, while 21-day DOM reflects intense buyer competition. Only 2.6 months of supply signals extreme seller advantage.

**Assessment:** Ultra-competitive market with bidding war potential. Price declines reflect market recalibration to affordability sweet spot, not weakness. Sellers can expect at or above-list offers on well-positioned properties.

---

### 4. Hollins, VA
**Sales Volume:** 22 homes | **Health Score:** 93/100 *(HIGHEST IN ENTIRE METRO)*

- **Median Sale Price:** $315,000 (+6.7% YoY)
- **Days on Market:** 31 days
- **Inventory:** 38 homes
- **Months of Supply:** 1.7
- **Sale-to-List Ratio:** 0.988

**Market Dynamics:**
Hollins stands as the Roanoke metro's strongest performer with a stunning 93 health score—higher than any Charlotte market. The combination of 6.7% price appreciation, 22.2% sales growth, and critically low 1.7-month supply creates optimal seller conditions. Inventory actually declined 24% MoM despite rising sales, indicating supply shortage.

**Assessment:** Extreme seller's market with inventory scarcity driving competition. Properties should price at top of range and expect multiple offers. Buyers face bidding wars on desirable listings.

---

### 5. North Shore, VA
**Sales Volume:** 21 homes | **Health Score:** 71/100

- **Median Sale Price:** $625,000 (+21.4% YoY)
- **Days on Market:** 39 days
- **Inventory:** 43 homes
- **Months of Supply:** 2.0
- **Sale-to-List Ratio:** 0.977

**Market Dynamics:**
North Shore represents Roanoke's luxury tier with explosive performance: sales more than doubled YoY (+133.3%) while prices surged 21.4%. The extraordinary 162.5% MoM sales spike suggests pent-up luxury demand releasing into the market. Despite inventory growth of 53.6% YoY, the 2.0-month supply remains in strong seller territory.

**Assessment:** Hot luxury market with exceptional appreciation. Waterfront/premium properties commanding significant premiums over prior year. Demand robust despite higher price points.

---

### 6. Rocky Mount, VA
**Sales Volume:** 7 homes | **Health Score:** 85/100 *(THIRD HIGHEST)*

- **Median Sale Price:** $218,000 (-3.1% YoY)
- **Days on Market:** 7 days *(FASTEST IN METRO)*
- **Inventory:** 15 homes
- **Months of Supply:** 2.1
- **Sale-to-List Ratio:** 0.999

**Market Dynamics:**
Rocky Mount achieves the metro's fastest median DOM at just 7 days, with sales exploding 600% YoY (from 1 to 7 transactions). The 85 health score reflects this extreme velocity despite low volume. Properties essentially sell immediately upon listing.

**Assessment:** Ultra-fast market with instant absorption. Limited data given low transaction volume, but trend is unmistakably strong. Affordability at $218K median drives first-time buyer urgency.

---

### 7. Vinton, VA
**Sales Volume:** 6 homes | **Health Score:** 81/100

- **Median Sale Price:** $228,750 (-9.2% YoY)
- **Days on Market:** 15 days
- **Inventory:** 15 homes
- **Months of Supply:** 2.5
- **Sale-to-List Ratio:** 0.998

**Market Dynamics:**
Vinton shows concerning -33.3% declines in both MoM and YoY sales, though the 15-day DOM suggests properties still move quickly when listed. Price erosion of 9.2% YoY indicates buyers negotiating down from peak levels. Health score remains strong at 81 due to rapid absorption.

**Assessment:** Transitioning market with sales velocity concerns but maintained buyer urgency for correctly-priced properties. Price expectations adjusting to new affordability baseline.

---

### 8. Westlake Corner, VA
**Sales Volume:** 6 homes | **Health Score:** 71/100

- **Median Sale Price:** $994,950 (+45.8% YoY)
- **Days on Market:** 44 days
- **Inventory:** 21 homes
- **Months of Supply:** 3.5
- **Sale-to-List Ratio:** 0.996

**Market Dynamics:**
Westlake Corner represents ultra-luxury segment with nearly $1M median price and explosive 45.8% YoY appreciation. Sales increased 50% YoY despite -22.9% MoM price volatility (likely driven by property mix in low-volume market). The 44-day DOM reflects limited luxury buyer pool but remains fast relative to Charlotte's luxury markets.

**Assessment:** High-end waterfront/estate market showing strong appreciation despite low volume. Luxury segment outperforming core market, suggesting wealth concentration and limited premier inventory.

---

### 9. Union Hall, VA
**Sales Volume:** 5 homes | **Health Score:** 71/100

- **Median Sale Price:** $1,534,999 (+68.7% YoY)
- **Days on Market:** 88 days
- **Inventory:** 10 homes
- **Months of Supply:** 2.0
- **Sale-to-List Ratio:** 0.982

**Market Dynamics:**
Union Hall occupies the metro's ultra-luxury tier with a stunning $1.535M median price and extraordinary 68.7% YoY appreciation. The 370.9% MoM price surge suggests an exceptional estate-level transaction distorting the median. Despite 88-day DOM (longest in top 10), the 2.0-month supply indicates scarcity at this price point.

**Assessment:** Elite luxury market with limited comparable transaction history. Statistical volatility high due to low volume, but trend shows sustained luxury demand. Properties of this caliber require longer marketing periods to find qualified buyers.

---

### 10. Cloverdale, VA
**Sales Volume:** 5 homes | **Health Score:** 79/100

- **Median Sale Price:** $505,000 (+61.1% YoY)
- **Days on Market:** 25 days
- **Inventory:** 10 homes
- **Months of Supply:** 2.0
- **Sale-to-List Ratio:** 0.998

**Market Dynamics:**
Cloverdale demonstrates exceptional momentum with sales quintupling YoY (+400%) and prices surging 61.1%. The 25-day DOM reflects strong buyer urgency despite premium pricing. Inventory increased 66.7% YoY but remains scarce at 2.0 months supply.

**Assessment:** Emerging hot market with explosive growth. Combination of rapid sales growth and strong appreciation suggests market discovery of Cloverdale's value proposition. Excellent opportunity for sellers to capitalize on momentum.

## CRITICAL ALERTS

### HIGH PRIORITY

**Roanoke Core Market Sales Velocity Decline**
- Sales dropped 31.8% MoM (148 to 101)
- Inventory surged 86.6% YoY

**Why it matters:** The metro's dominant market showing significant monthly slowdown. While 24-day DOM remains healthy, the sharp MoM decline suggests seasonal adjustment or demand saturation. YoY sales growth of only 11% lags metro average of 48.6%.

**Action:** Monitor October data closely. If decline continues, core Roanoke may be approaching equilibrium after hot growth period. Sellers should price competitively as inventory doubles.

---

**Luxury Market Price Volatility**
- Union Hall: +370.9% MoM price swing
- Westlake Corner: -22.9% MoM
- Penhook: -47.8% MoM

**Why it matters:** Low transaction volumes at luxury tier create statistical noise, but extreme swings indicate unpredictable pricing discovery. Buyers and sellers lack reliable comparable sales for valuation.

**Action:** Ultra-luxury properties ($900K+) require custom appraisals and longer marketing periods. Use 3-6 month rolling averages rather than monthly snapshots for pricing guidance.

---

**Inventory Surge Across All Markets**
- Metro-wide inventory +58.2% YoY
- Cave Spring +54.4%, North Shore +53.6%, Cloverdale +66.7%

**Why it matters:** While still tight by absolute standards (2.8 months supply), the rapid inventory growth exceeds sales growth in most markets. If trend continues, could shift market toward buyer advantage by late 2025 or early 2026.

**Action:** Sellers should list aggressively now before further inventory accumulation reduces urgency. Buyers can afford to be slightly more patient as choices expand.

---

### MEDIUM PRIORITY

**Salem and Vinton Sales Declines**
- Salem: -21.2% MoM sales
- Vinton: -33.3% MoM and YoY sales

**Why it matters:** Two of top 10 markets showing weakening transaction velocity despite fast DOM. Price erosion in both markets (-7.9% and -9.2% YoY respectively) suggests affordability ceilings being tested.

**Assessment:** Markets may be self-correcting through price adjustments. Monitor for stabilization in Q4.

---

**Small Market Statistical Noise**
- Rocky Mount: 600% sales surge from 1 to 7 transactions
- Cloverdale: 400% sales surge from 1 to 5 transactions

**Why it matters:** Low-volume markets experience extreme percentage volatility. Single transactions can distort monthly metrics significantly.

**Action:** Use caution interpreting small market trends. Focus on 3-6 month rolling averages for reliability.

---

## POSITIVE INDICATORS

### Explosive Sales Growth
- Metro sales +48.6% YoY (243 vs 163)
- North Shore sales more than doubled
- Multiple cities showing triple-digit YoY growth

**Interpretation:** Roanoke experiencing genuine demand surge, not statistical artifact. In-migration, affordability relative to larger metros, and pent-up demand driving exceptional performance.

---

### Lightning-Fast Absorption
- Median 26-day DOM metro-wide
- Rocky Mount averaging 7 days
- 4 of top 10 cities under 25 days

**Interpretation:** Properties priced correctly receive immediate buyer interest. Market has no patience for overpricing but rewards aggressive positioning.

---

### Luxury Segment Outperformance
- North Shore (+21.4% price YoY)
- Westlake Corner (+45.8%)
- Union Hall (+68.7%)
- Cloverdale (+61.1%)

**Interpretation:** Wealth accumulation and remote work flexibility enabling luxury purchases. High-end buyers less interest-rate sensitive than first-time buyers.

---

### Stable Pricing in Core Markets
- Metro median +4.1% YoY - healthy sustainable growth
- Most price declines modest (3-9%) and tactical
- Sale-to-list ratios near parity indicate proper pricing

**Interpretation:** Market demonstrating fundamental value support. Corrections are minor adjustments, not crash scenarios.

---

## STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS

### For Sellers

#### Listing Strategy
1. **Price Aggressively:** With 26-day median DOM, overpricing risks losing motivated buyers who move to next option quickly. Price at top of recent comps but avoid aspirational pricing.

2. **Expect Fast Offers:** Core markets averaging 18-31 days DOM. Properties lingering beyond 45 days signal pricing issues requiring immediate adjustment.

3. **Capitalize on Scarcity:** Markets with <2.5 months supply (Salem, Hollins, Rocky Mount, North Shore) should price at premium end of range and expect multiple offers.

4. **Timing is Critical:** With inventory surging 58% YoY, seller advantage may diminish through late 2025. List now rather than waiting for spring 2026.

#### Market Positioning
1. **Hollins/Salem/Rocky Mount:** Price at or above recent comps. Build in 2-3% escalation potential for bidding wars.

2. **Roanoke Core:** Price competitively given inventory surge. Properties must show well to compete in expanding choices.

3. **Luxury Markets (Union Hall, Westlake Corner):** Accept 60-90 day marketing periods. Price based on 6-month rolling averages, not monthly snapshots.

---

### For Buyers

#### Acquisition Strategy
1. **Act Decisively:** 26-day average DOM means top properties receive offers quickly. Extended due diligence periods will result in lost opportunities.

2. **Target Cooling Markets:** Roanoke core, Salem, and Vinton showing sales velocity declines. These markets offer slightly more negotiating room than Hollins or Cave Spring.

3. **Avoid Bidding Wars in Hot Markets:** Hollins (93 health score) and Salem (83) likely to generate multiple offers. Consider secondary markets with similar characteristics but less competition.

4. **Leverage Inventory Growth:** 58% YoY inventory surge means more choices. Walk away from overpriced listings; comparable alternatives will appear within weeks.

#### Financial Positioning
1. **Pre-Approval Essential:** In markets averaging <30 DOM, sellers prioritize pre-approved buyers who can close quickly.

2. **Escalation Clauses:** In competitive markets, consider automatic escalation up to maximum comfortable price to win bidding wars.

3. **Inspection Contingencies:** While important for due diligence, be prepared to accept properties with minor issues in hot markets where sellers have multiple backup offers.

---

### For Investors

#### Growth Opportunities
1. **Cloverdale:** 400% sales surge and 61% price appreciation suggest emerging market discovery. Consider long-term appreciation plays before market fully prices in demand.

2. **Rocky Mount:** 600% sales growth at affordable $218K median. Potential first-time buyer and rental demand given proximity to employment centers.

3. **Cave Spring:** Premium suburban market with 78 health score and 18-day DOM. Long-term value retention likely given desirability and school districts.

#### Risk Factors
1. **Luxury Volatility:** Markets above $600K median show extreme price swings month-to-month. Cash flow unlikely from rentals at these price points; appreciation speculation only.

2. **Low-Volume Markets:** Cities with <10 monthly sales prone to statistical noise. Single transactions can create false trends. Require longer observation periods.

3. **Inventory Surge:** While currently absorbed, 58% YoY inventory growth could flip market dynamics if sales growth slows. Monitor absorption rates quarterly.

## MARKET OUTLOOK

### Short-Term (Q4 2025)
- **Seasonal Slowdown Expected:** October-December typically sees 20-30% volume reduction. Core Roanoke's -31.8% MoM decline may represent early seasonal pattern.
- **Price Stability:** Core markets should maintain +3-5% YoY appreciation. Luxury tier may see continued volatility but positive trend.
- **Inventory Absorption Test:** Q4 will determine if 58% YoY inventory growth can be absorbed without pricing pressure. Expect DOM to extend to 35-40 days metro-wide.

**Seller Strategy:** List before Thanksgiving or wait for spring 2026. Winter listings face reduced buyer pool and extended marketing periods.

**Buyer Strategy:** November-January offers slightly more negotiating leverage as motivated sellers face year-end pressures and reduced competition from other buyers.

---

### Medium-Term (2026)
- **Continued Inventory Growth:** Expect active listings to approach 900-1,000 by mid-2026 as builders and sellers respond to strong 2025 pricing.
- **Normalization to 3.5-4.5 Months Supply:** Market will transition from extreme seller's market (2.8 months) toward balanced conditions as inventory accumulates.
- **Sales Growth Moderation:** 48.6% YoY growth unsustainable. Expect 10-15% annual growth in 2026 as market matures.
- **DOM Stabilization:** 30-40 days will become new normal, up from current 26 but still faster than Charlotte's 69 days.

**Strategic Focus:** Markets with sustained sub-3-month supply (Hollins, Salem, Rocky Mount) will maintain pricing power longest. Core Roanoke and luxury tier will feel inventory pressure first.

---

### Long-Term Factors (2027+)
- **Roanoke Growth Drivers:** Virginia Tech proximity, healthcare sector (Carilion), outdoor recreation, and relative affordability versus DC/Richmond metros support in-migration.
- **Remote Work Advantage:** Roanoke offers quality of life and lower cost of living for remote professionals, potentially sustaining demand beyond traditional economic cycles.
- **Infrastructure Limitations:** Smaller metro size limits absorption capacity. Sustained inventory growth could pressure prices if economic shocks reduce in-migration.
- **Interest Rate Sensitivity:** When rates decline to 5-6% (projected late 2026), expect demand surge. Current inventory growth positions market well to absorb rate-driven demand spike.

---

## CONCLUSION

Roanoke's September 2025 market reveals a metro experiencing exceptional momentum, with sales growth (+ 48.6% YoY) tripling Charlotte's performance despite rapid inventory accumulation. The 26-day median DOM—62% faster than Charlotte—demonstrates sustained buyer urgency across nearly all price tiers.

The market's defining characteristic is velocity: properties priced correctly receive immediate buyer interest, with multiple cities averaging <25-day absorption. This speed creates seller advantages but also punishes overpricing, as buyers quickly move to next option in expanding inventory pool.

Market bifurcation is evident but different from Charlotte's pattern. Instead of growth corridors versus declining suburbs, Roanoke shows tiered performance by price point: luxury markets (North Shore, Union Hall, Westlake Corner) experiencing explosive appreciation (21-69% YoY) while core affordability markets (Roanoke, Salem, Vinton) show modest price compression (-3 to -9% YoY) as they recalibrate to sustainable levels.

The metro's health score distribution is exceptional: 7 of 10 top cities score 71+ (versus 4 of 10 in Charlotte), with Hollins achieving a remarkable 93—the highest score in either metro. This reflects balanced fundamentals across velocity, pricing, and inventory metrics.

**Critical Inflection Point:** The 58.2% YoY inventory surge, while currently absorbed, represents a potential market shift if sales growth slows. Roanoke's smaller size means inventory accumulation reaches critical mass faster than larger metros. Sellers have window of opportunity through late 2025 before expanding supply reduces urgency.

**Looking ahead:** Q4 seasonal slowdown will test absorption capacity. Spring 2026 will likely see sustained seller advantages in sub-3-month supply markets (Hollins, Salem, Rocky Mount) while core Roanoke transitions toward balance. Long-term Roanoke fundamentals—affordability, quality of life, Virginia Tech proximity—support continued in-migration and sustainable appreciation, though at more moderate rates than 2025's exceptional performance.

**Final Assessment:** Roanoke operates as a compressed, high-velocity version of Charlotte's market dynamics—faster absorption, tighter supply, more immediate buyer urgency, but also more vulnerable to inventory shocks given smaller scale. Success requires precision timing and aggressive pricing to capture current seller advantages before inevitable normalization.
