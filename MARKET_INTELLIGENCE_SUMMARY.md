## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Charlotte-Concord-Gastonia Market
**Market Health Score:** 55/100
**Sentiment:** NEUTRAL
**Status:** Balanced market conditions

**Key Findings:**
- Median listing price: $438,500 (-0.3% MoM, +2.0% YoY)
- Active inventory: 10,131 units (+3.9% MoM, +36.0% YoY)
- Days on market: 58 days (+1.8% MoM, +20.2% YoY)
- Pending ratio: 0.4911 (moderate buyer activity)
- Price reductions: 48.5% of active inventory

**Market Characterization:**
Charlotte shows balanced conditions with stable pricing but significantly elevated inventory compared to last year (+36% YoY). The market has transitioned from tight inventory conditions to a more buyer-favorable environment. Sales velocity has slowed with homes taking 20% longer to sell than last year. Pricing power has shifted with nearly half of inventory experiencing price reductions.

**Strategic Implication:**
Sellers need competitive pricing and strong presentation. Buyers have more negotiating leverage and time to make decisions. The market favors realistic pricing from the start rather than testing higher price points.

### Roanoke Market
**Market Health Score:** 40/100
**Sentiment:** BEARISH
**Status:** Softening market conditions

**Key Findings:**
- Median listing price: $359,852 (-2.5% MoM, -2.7% YoY)
- Active inventory: 947 units (+1.5% MoM, +38.8% YoY)
- Days on market: 58 days (+12.6% MoM, +28.9% YoY)
- Pending ratio: 0.5792 (still showing buyer interest)
- New listings: 416 (-7.1% MoM, +3.5% YoY)

**Market Characterization:**
Roanoke displays more pronounced softening with declining prices both month-over-month and year-over-year. Inventory has surged 38.8% compared to last September while sales velocity has slowed considerably. Despite these challenges, the pending ratio remains relatively healthy at 0.58, suggesting buyer interest persists but at lower price points. New listing flow has contracted recently, potentially indicating seller hesitancy.

**Strategic Implication:**
This is a buyer's market requiring aggressive pricing strategies. Sellers face meaningful pricing pressure and need to be realistic about current market values. Properties must be priced competitively from day one. Staging and condition are critical differentiators.

## HISTORICAL CONTEXT

### September 2025 vs September 2024

Both markets show similar patterns:
1. **Inventory Normalization:** Massive YoY inventory growth (35-40%) after years of tight supply
2. **Velocity Slowdown:** Sales taking 20-30% longer than last year
3. **Demand Shift:** Pending ratios down 11-13% YoY, indicating reduced buyer urgency
4. **Price Divergence:** Charlotte holding value (+2% YoY), Roanoke correcting (-2.7% YoY)

This represents a fundamental market transition from seller-favorable to more balanced/buyer-favorable conditions.

### 9-Year Perspective (Since 2016)

The data spans 111 months from July 2016 to September 2025, capturing:
- Post-2016 recovery and growth
- COVID-era buying surge (2020-2021)
- Inventory drought (2021-2023)
- Current normalization phase (2024-2025)

September 2025 represents a market attempting to find equilibrium after extraordinary conditions.

## SUPPORT & QUESTIONS

### Understanding Metrics

**Median Listing Price:** Middle value of all listed prices (half above, half below)
**Active Listings:** Currently available properties on market
**Days on Market:** Median time from listing to sale/pending
**New Listings:** Properties newly listed in the month
**Pending Listings:** Properties under contract but not yet closed
**Pending Ratio:** Pending listings divided by active listings (demand indicator)
**Price Reductions:** Properties that lowered asking price
**Price Increases:** Properties that raised asking price

### Interpreting Trends

**MoM (Month-over-Month):** Change from previous month (August to September)
**YoY (Year-over-Year):** Change from same month last year (Sep 2024 to Sep 2025)

Positive percentages don't always mean "good" - context matters:
- Higher prices = good for sellers, bad for buyers
- Higher inventory = good for buyers, challenging for sellers
- Higher days on market = slower velocity, often buyer-favorable
